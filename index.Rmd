Emma can usually be found with a cup of tea or coffee working on her latest project in R. She is currently a senior at Smith College, studying Statistical and Data Sciences. This semester she co-authored the R package [**readUCI**](https://github.com/emmal73/readUCI).


She has completed coursework in advanced programming in R and advanced statistics such as structural equation modeling and actor-partner interdependence modeling. This semester she is completing the capstone project for the SDS major. In the fall she participated as a mentee in the Out in Tech mentorship program, and built a [shiny app](https://github.com/emmal73/emma_out_in_tech/tree/master/GBM) about gradient booster models.

In 2018 her team A-super-NOVA won "Best in Group" for the presentation at DataFest, presenting a new "competitiveness index" based on Indeed.com data.
